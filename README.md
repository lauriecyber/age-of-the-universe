Estimating the age of the Universe.

Check out The Hubble Constant and the Age of the Universe.ipynb. It's a Jupyter notebook walking through a calculation of the Hubble Constant and the age of the universe using Cepheid galaxies. For some reason, Github takes issue with the latex rendering in the notebook. This should correct itself if you download the notebook.
